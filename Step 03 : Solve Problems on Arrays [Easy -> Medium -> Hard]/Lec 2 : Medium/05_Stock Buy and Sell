Title: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
--------------------------------------
Problem Statement:
You are given an array `prices` where prices[i] is the price of a stock on the i-th day.
You must choose a single day to buy one stock and a different day in the future to sell it.
Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. 
If no profit is possible, return 0.

Example:
--------
Input:  prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6).

Approach (Single Pass - O(n)):
------------------------------
1. Initialize:
   - `bp` (Buy Price) = Integer.MAX_VALUE
   - `maxProfit` = 0

2. Traverse the array:
   - If current price > bp → calculate potential profit = price - bp
     and update `maxProfit` if it’s greater.
   - Else → update `bp` = current price (found a new lower buying price).

3. Return `maxProfit`.

Time Complexity:  O(n)
   - Single pass through the price list.
Space Complexity: O(1)
   - Only constant extra variables used.

class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int n = prices.length;
        int bp = Integer.MAX_VALUE; // Lowest price seen so far (buy price)
        int maxProfit = 0;          // Maximum profit found so far

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (prices[i] > bp) {
                // Potential profit if selling today
                int profit = prices[i] - bp;
                maxProfit = Math.max(maxProfit, profit);
            } else {
                // Found a new minimum price to buy
                bp = prices[i];
            }
        }
        return maxProfit;
    }
}
